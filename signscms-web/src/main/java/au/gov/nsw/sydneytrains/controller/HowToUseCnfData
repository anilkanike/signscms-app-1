How to use CnfData class

At start up
- Create instance of class
- Call readFromSource
    TODO: should it be optional to read from a file or a database?
    TODO: should file directories be configurable?

When a player connects (IN hostname)
- Call getDevice with the hostname
    A configured device will return a CnfDevice, otherwise null
- Call getLink with CnfDevice.getDeviceId
    A CnfLink will be returned, otherwise null
    Get CnfLink.getViewId which can return 0 (blank)
- Call getView with the viewId
    A CnfView should be returned, but otherwise null (error condition)
- Call CnfView.getAsJSON
    The JSON string contains the configured view (a series of image filenames)

When a user connects
- Call getAllDevicesAsJSON
- Call getAllViewsAsJSON
- Call getAllLinksAsJSON
    The JSON strings contain all the configured information

When a user presses the submit button (IN deviceId, viewId)
- viewId can be 0 (blank view)
- update the links
- Call writeToSource
